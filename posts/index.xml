      <description>I always had a question, if Golang does not have the static variable, how could it gracefully handle long lifetime variables except using global variables?
Until last night, I saw this Exercise: Fibonacci closure in A tour of Go. I have to admit I am not a fan of closure, sometimes it makes easy logic complex. But it is still great for learning.

      <description>My very first impression of a mechanical keyboard is a clunky ISO layout IBM keyboard on which I learned touch typing, I can still remember it was full of noise like rusty sprints. Then suddenly, the whole world is dominated by membrane keyboards for its low cost and quiet experience.
As a fan of keyboards and mice. I owned Logitech mice M505, M525, and M545, guess what? I only paid the first one, they kept broken within the warranty and got replaced.</description>

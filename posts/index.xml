      <description>Recently, I started to think about learning $\TeX$, adding $\TeX$ support to blog looks like a good start for me. It took me quite some time to figure out all the culprits of embedding $\TeX$ in markdown. I hope this blog could save you some time on the same setup.
Required Components  The default Blackfriday markdown engine. $\KaTeX$ math typesetting library for the web.  Steps to Setup $\KaTeX$ in Hugo $\KaTeX$ is an excellent fast engineer for rendering $\TeX$ on web.</description>

      <description>Question Given an array of integers $A (a_i \geq 0, i \in [0, n])$ and a threshold $T$.
If $\sum_{i = 0}^n a_i &amp;gt; T$, find an integer $t$, for $a_i &amp;gt; t (i \in [0, n]) \to a_i = t$.
Find the largest $t$ which makes $\sum_{i = 0}^n a_i \leq T$.
Answer ArraySummaryThreshold.go

      <description>I always had a question, if Golang does not have the static variable, how could it gracefully handle long lifetime variables except using global variables?
Until last night, I saw this Exercise: Fibonacci closure in A tour of Go. I have to admit I am not a fan of closure, sometimes it makes easy logic complex. But it is still great for learning.

      <description>My very first impression of a mechanical keyboard is a clunky ISO layout IBM keyboard on which I learned touch typing, I can still remember it was full of noise like rusty sprints. Then suddenly, the whole world is dominated by membrane keyboards for its low cost and quiet experience.
As a fan of keyboards and mice. I owned Logitech mice M505, M525, and M545, guess what? I only paid the first one, they kept broken within the warranty and got replaced.</description>

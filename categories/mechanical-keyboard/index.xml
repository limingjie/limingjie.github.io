      <description>My very first impression of a mechanical keyboard is a clunky ISO layout IBM keyboard on which I learned touch typing, I can still remember it was full of noise like rusty sprints. Then suddenly, the whole world is dominated by membrane keyboards for its low cost and quiet experience.
As a fan of keyboards and mice. I owned Logitech mice M505, M525, and M545, guess what? I only paid the first one, they kept broken within the warranty and got replaced.</description>
